## Election Audit Summary
The script can be put to good use for future elections. It shows that most of the voters are in the county of Denver. Future candidates can use this to know where to focus their campaigns. It can also help give predictions before all the votes have been tallied, such as if a candidate has a large lead in Denver with half the votes in that could potentially call the race for that candidate.
